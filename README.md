Script to peform the subtraction between two dose maps. Includes a registration and resampling step if the two dose maps have different origins and sizes.

Future versions will also include a ROI-based analysis where the mean, median, max and min difference in each ROI is quantified.

This code was written in the context of a project aiming to study the difference between dosemaps calculated on CT and those calculated on a CBCT.
